The garden is an ongoing work in progress. Each year we have added more milkwee and nectar-source flowers, shrubs and trees to draw monarchs. We are holding another volunteer effort to add compost and leaf mulch and plant more varieties of milkweed on April 15, 2017. Each year we host 4 volunteer work days on the site to plant, add compost and protect the plants with mulching. We forgot to apply for signage and are hoping that it's not too late to get a sign for the garden. We would really like to have one.",
